<h2>Snake Game</h2>


The classic Snake game is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that grows in length by eating food while avoiding walls and the snake's own body. The snake moves continuously in a set direction and responds to player input to change direction. Eating food increases the snake's length and the player's score. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself. Its simplicity and addictive nature have made it a timeless and popular choice among gamers.
