<h2>Snake Game</h2>


The classic Snake game is a classic arcade game where players control a snake that grows in length by eating food while avoiding walls and the snake's own body. The snake moves continuously in a set direction and responds to player input to change direction. Eating food increases the snake's length and the player's score. The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself. Its simplicity and addictive nature have made it a timeless and popular choice among gamers. The code was written so that the high score would be saved even after exiting the program and to retrieve the high score next time game runs again.
